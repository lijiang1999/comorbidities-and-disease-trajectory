##EHR analysis to demonstrate the lifetime comorbidities and disease trajectory of Uveitis 

#Step 1. process a list of longitudianl encounter data mapped to ICD10/9 codes and generate age of onset
#Step 2. illustrate the comorbidities of Uveitis in the Upset plot using a mapped phecodes matrix file  
#Step 3. create files to determine each comorbidity before or after Uveitis
#Step 4. create a combined long-format file with diagonstic order
#Step 5. demonstrate the disease trajectory of patients with Uveitis using Sankey plot with or without plotly
